The goal is to predict the total_cases label for each (city, year, weekofyear) in the test set. There are two cities, San Juan and Iquitos, with test data 
for each city spanning 5 and 3 years respectively.The data for each city have been concatenated along with a city column indicating 
the source: sj for San Juan and iq for Iquitos

**Column Description**
